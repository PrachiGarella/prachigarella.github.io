								<h2>My history with books</h2>
								<p>I was not a big reader growing up, but by the age of 16-17 I had grown a love for books. Now I am a literal book dragon, who enjoys reading and even with a hectic schedule as a grad student I make sure to find some time to smell the pages of my books. Wherever I have travelled and lived, I've always managed to create a bookshelf. In this picture you can find some books I have loved over the years.

									<p><li>That Sounds Fun: The Joys of Being an Amateur, the Power of Falling in Love, and Why You Need a Hobby by Annie F. Downs</li></p>
									<p>"How often do we call escapism "fun"? That's the real question for me. When I'm looking to define fun in my own life, to figure out how to handle the thing I don't know how to handle or how to process the pain I don't know what to do with, I wonder if I'm actually planning fun or just using fun to describe running away."</p>

									<p><li>Tomorrow,and Tomorrow,and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin</li></p>
									<p>“Friendship is friendship, and charity is charity.... the people who give you charity are never your friends. It is not possible to receive charity from a friend.”</p>

									<p><li>Lessons From Lucy: The Simple Joys of an Old, Happy Dog by Dave Barry</li></p>
									<p>“Boomer who, while riding in the car, saw another dog and jumped out the car window while the car was traveling at a fairly high rate of speed. Upon landing, Boomer broke a number of important bones. He had to wear casts during a long and difficult recovery. Finally he healed, and not long after, he was again riding in the moving car, and he saw another dog. With no hesitation whatsoever he jumped out again.”</p>

									<p><li>When We Cease to Understand the World by Benjamín Labatut</li></p>
									<p>“Decades before, Zyklon A--a precursor to the poison em-
										ployed by the Nazis in their concentration camps- -had been sprayed on California oranges, as a pesticide, and used to de-
										louse the trains in which tens of thousands of Mexican immigrants hid when entering the United States. The wood of the
										train cars was stained a beautiful blue, the same colbur that car
										be seen even today on certain bricks at Auschwitz; both hearken to cyanide's authentic origins as a by-product isolated in 1782 from the first modern synthetic pigment, Prussian Blue.”</p>
