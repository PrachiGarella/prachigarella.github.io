								<h3><li><p>Episode 7: Andrew Baldassarre on patriarchal realism and the pedagogical power of porn<p></li><h3>
									<p>Every rational human has once in their life thought about the implications of porn on oneself and the society. Gail Dines, an anti-porn sociologist and professor at Wheelock college claims in her work that due to the adverse implications of pornography, it has become a public health issue and perhaps a solution is to enforce a complete ban on the porn industry. Our guest today Andrew Baldassarre is a philosopher and his current work is in response to this idea. He believes that it is important to acknowledge the pedagogical power of porn and to harness this aspect for the betterment of our society.<p>

								<h3><li><p>Episode 6: Deepak Singh Rawat on Literature, fiction and philosophy<p></li><h3>
									<p>The path to self-exploration is very unique for everyone. Our passion, ambition and relationships play an instrumental role in shaping our lives. Our guest today found his true expression and self in literature. His humility and empathy allowed him to overcome all the challenges that life threw at him. With exploring literature, friendships, love, life and lots of laughter, this was one of the most heartfelt conversation in a very long time.

								<h3><li><p>Episode 5: Bikash Panthi on Challenges Faced by International Students in the US</p></li><h3>
									<p>A lot of students all around the world
										leave their home country and move to another
										county to prsue higher education. We often
										talk about their learnings and success but in
										reality what goes behind all that enlightenment is mostly never talked about. Our guest today has a PhD in physics who left his country, his family
										in Nepal, to pursue his career in the states.
										Even though this journey was not ideal, his
										sanguine nature lead him to where he is now.

								<h3><li><p>Episode 4: Pablo Lopez-Duque on the research community, physics and philosophy</p></li><h3>
									<p> We all know PhD one complete adventure like none other. There exist factors that we don't know anything when we begin our PhD. You can never expect how drastically the research project, advisor and the overall situation can change. Our guest today faced all such challenges and it only made him more strong, mature and confident. 
										From having material science as his primary interest he now works in the Quantum Gravity Group.

								<h3><li><p>Episode 3: Caleb Broodo on Basketball, Engineering and life as a Physics Graduate Student</p></li><h3>
									<p> In Life one finds it difficult to find what truly makes them happy. 
										Our guest today is someone who did not have such a problem. He is a physics graduate student, but that's not how his journey began.  Caleb Broodo left his basketball career, his dream to play in the NBA and his engineering pursuit to pursue his other dream of becoming a physicist.

								<h3><li><p>Episode 2: Tripp Moss on Changing Careers, from being a wealth manager to a grad student</p></li><h3>
									<p>  Have you ever found yourself in a situation when you you're passionate about something, you love something and you've learn to appreciate it from a very very young age but then life happened. 
										Our guest today did his undergrad in mechanical engineering and physics but had to make a circumstantial switch to the finance industry. He then spent more than six year and found his was back to physics. This is a fun, fascinating and a very exciting episode. We hope to inspire people in similar situations and we want to let them know that they're not alone and all hope is not lost.

								<h3><li><p>Episode 1: Pilot</p></li><h3>
								<p>You've already seen our Vlogs and enjoyed our nomadic side. 
									We have been planning to do this Podcast for a very long and finally we found the time to make it happen. We finally justify the 'Know' of Knowmads and we kickstart this podcast by addressing a common question that we always get: 
									"How do you manage your relationship being in the same profession? How do you manage your personal and professional life? and much more.." 
									We come out completely honest about what bothers us and how we actually make it work. 
									We would love to inspire those in a similar situation and we hope that others can also take something from this. 
									We hope to have ya'll along this journey of exploring not just ourselves but also the world around us. We also look forward to expand our knowledge along with you. We will try to bring unique stories and research that will definitely help people in graduate school. </p>
