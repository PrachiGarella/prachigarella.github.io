						<h3><li><p>Episode 17: Andreas Karch on the Stringy Nature of the Universe <p></li><h3>
							<p> Modern physics rests on two foundational frameworks that describe our universe at different scales. The first is General Relativity, Einstein’s theory of gravity, which describes gravity not as a force but as the curvature of spacetime itself. Massive objects bend the geometry of spacetime, and this curvature dictates how all massive objects move, from planets to black holes.
								At the microscopic scale, we have quantum mechanics which describes the probabilistic nature of particles like electrons and photons. Quantum mechanics also laid the foundation for Quantum Field Theory where particles are no longer seen as standalone objects but as excitations of quantum fields that permeate spacetime. This is the formalism behind the Standard Model of particle physics, our best theory to date for describing the electromagnetic, weak, and strong nuclear forces.
							Individually, both theories aren’t just theoretically robust but also experimentally validated. However, combining them isn’t as easy as it sounds. The mathematical frameworks of General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory are fundamentally incompatible. When we try to apply quantum principles to spacetime itself, like at the singularity of a black hole or during the earliest moments of the universe, the equations break down.
						One of the most ambitious and mathematically rich attempts to reconcile these two frameworks is String Theory. In string theory, the point-like particles of the Standard Model are replaced by tiny vibrating strings, and different vibrational modes correspond to different particles. Even though string theory comes with its own challenges, like the need to compactify extra dimensions, it remains one of the most compelling candidates for a unified theory of nature. One of its greatest successes lies in the discovery of dualities which connects seemingly unrelated theories. Among the most powerful of these is the AdS/CFT correspondence, or gauge/gravity duality, which proposes an equivalence between a theory of gravity in higher-dimensional spacetime and a quantum field theory without gravity on its lower-dimensional boundary.
					Our guest today is Professor Andreas Karch, a theoretical physicist at the University of Texas at Austin, who has played a key role in shaping our understanding of gauge/gravity duality and has made significant contributions to string theory. If you’re someone curious about why we need to quantize gravity, eager to unpack the ideas behind string theory, or simply excited to explore the frontiers of fundamental physics — you’re in for a treat.</p>

						<h3><li><p>Episode 16: Kaden Hazard on the Exotic Nature of Paraparticles<p></li><h3>
							<p> The world we live in is believed to be divided into two fundamental families of particles--Fermions and Bosons. Today, we're sitting in Dr. Kaden Hazzard's beautiful office at Rice University in Houston, who along with his student, proposed a robust third class of particles called paraparticles. An astonishingly simple operation of swapping any two particles, is what it takes to reveal their nature. We know that Bosons obey BE statistics and Fermions obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. But what about paraparticles? What statistics do they obey? Where do they show up? And what could their existence mean for physics? If you're curious about the foundations of quantum mechanics or just need a reason to chase a wild idea — you're going to love this episode</p>

						<h3><li><p>Episode 15: Rene Bellwied on winning the breakthrough prize in fundamental Physics<p></li><h3>
							<p> Since Season 2 was long overdue, we had to start with someone who is not just had a remarkable academic journey in physics, but also someone who’s been a great mentor to all his students and really, to everyone who walks into his office. So in this episode, we’re sitting in the office of Professor René Bellwied — a leading experimental physicist and a core member of the ALICE collaboration — which stands for A Large Ion Collider Experiment — one of the major experiments at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider or the LHC.
                                A few days ago, along with his colleges, he recieved the 2025 breakthrough prize in fundamental physics, which is one of the most prestigious award in science. We talk about the early universe, the beauty and chaos of large-scale collaborations, and what the future of physics might hold. Whether you're someone who thinks deeply about the universe or someone who just loves hearing how big science gets done, there's something for everyone.
								This is a beautiful conversation where we talk about her challenges, and the invaluable lessons she's gathered along the way.</p>
