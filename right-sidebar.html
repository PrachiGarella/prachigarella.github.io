										<h3>Youtube</h3>
										<p>My youtube journey started in collaboration with my boyfriend when we went to England for our masters. My boyfriend (also a physicist) shares a passion for travel (along with passion for physics) and as a consequence started a channel called the 'The Knowmads' where we started posting our travel vlogs in early 2019. However due to Covid-19 travel came to a hault and so did the vlogs. In 2020 I started my own YouTube Channel where I shared by literature reviews, daily vlogs, my love for meditation and a lot more. About the picture: The picture below has a few of my Youtube thumbnails. The most recent one is from a trip to New York.  </p>

											<h3>Instagram</h3>
											<p> I started posting on instagram in early 2018. Initially I posted about travel and fashion but later I started to include my journey through academia. I feel content creation has drastically changed the face of social media in the past five years. My number one rule as a content creator is that I only make content that is true to myself and resonates my beliefs. I am strictly against promoting things that I personally don't accept. Since this is not my full time profession, I consider it as a digital memory storing platform for my future self that also serves as a medium to share my thoughts, journey and knowledge.
												About the picture: In the first picture you can see a few posts that I have shared on Instagram. </p>

											<h3>Book Blog</h3>
											<p>I was not a big reader growing up, but by the age of 16-17 I had grown a love for books. Now I am a literal book dragon, who enjoys reading and even with a hectic schedule as a grad student I make sure to find some time to smell the pages of my books. Wherever I have travelled and lived, I've always managed to create a bookshelf. In the picture above you can find some books I have loved over the years. </p>
											<p>I am currently reading: 'The Order of Time' by Carlo Rovelli and 'Klara and the Sun' by kazuo Ishiguro </p>
